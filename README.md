# problems

adafruit-io lib is not available, seems simpleio solves the issue

# font 

- woff to png with AA: https://stmn.itch.io/font2bitmap
- png to bmp: https://convertio.co/

These bmp are not showing AA in CPY

We need indexed bmp, but https://online-converting.com/image/convert2bmp/# produces bmp as wite line (something not working)
